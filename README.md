# US Accidents Exploratory Data Analysis

## Introduction:
I have examined the impact of 3 groups of factors on accident severity in the US:
1. Time
2. Weather
3. Infrastructure

Severity is a number between 1 and 4, where 1 indicates the least impact on traffic {i.e., short delay as a result of the accident} and 4 indicates a significant impact on traffic {i.e., long delay}.

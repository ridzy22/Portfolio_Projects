# Covid-19 data Project (Python)

Welcome to the COVID-19 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) repository in Python! This repository is dedicated to analyzing and visualizing data related to the COVID-19 pandemic using Python programming language.

## Introduction:
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted our lives, and understanding the data associated with it is crucial for effective decision-making and public health measures. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) plays a vital role in gaining insights from data, uncovering patterns, and visualizing trends.

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive Python notebook that performs EDA on COVID-19 data. By leveraging the power of Python's data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, we can explore, clean, analyze, and visualize COVID-19 datasets.
